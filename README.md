# Description

My test project to play with Sony Toio.

# Installation

1. Install the package with `pip`. If you want to just try, `pip install -e .` would be convenient.
2. Power on your Toio cubes, and run `scan-cubes.sh`. It will create `toio-cubes.txt` that includes the MAC addresses of your cubes.
3. Run examples, e.g. `python examples/soccer.py`
