errors.txt
List of most likely errors for each robot (for designing and debugging code).

DRAW
*


PUSH
*card gets stuck on middle lip of board
    SOLUTION: back up and try again

FLIP
*card is not contacted by the robot, so it doesn't flip
    SOLUTION: hmm, we probably need feedback from the camera to determine when this happens
    - perhaps we adjust the position that the robot drives to?

DEAL
*card gets stuck under robot, causing robot to drive over it and stop
    SOLUTION: back up and try again
