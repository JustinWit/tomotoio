(voiceover): Blackjack is a classic casino card game between a dealer and one or more players, 
where the goal is to collect cards having a higher total value than the dealer, without going over 21. 
In this project, we replace the human dealer with four toio robots, each equipped with custom 
attachment mechanisms to jointly accomplish the dealer's tasks. Tasks include drawing a card 
from the deck, moving the card, flipping the card, and dealing the card to the correct player.
User interaction includes tapping the robot to hit and receive another card.
