(voiceover): Blackjack is a classic casino card game between a dealer and one or more players, 
with the goal being to have cards that totals as close to 21 as possible. Players are initially 
dealt 2 cards and must decide whether to hit meaning draw a card or stand. The dealer then has the same options.
To replace a dealer with robots, there are 4 main tasks, drawing a card, fliping the card, dealing 
the card, and reacting to the players choice to hit or stand. Our project uses Toio robots to accomplish
these tasks and play a game of blackjack.
